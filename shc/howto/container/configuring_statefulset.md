# Configuring Stateful Sets

The automatic container deployment service supports Kubernetes Stateful Set resources (stateful sets). The Stateful Set resource deployment supports environment variable configuration to achieve JVM adaptation within the container.

The steps for creating and managing Stateful Sets are similar to the configuration of Deployments. For details, see [Configuring Deployments](configuring_deployment).
