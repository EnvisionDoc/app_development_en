# Terminology

This topic introduces the major concepts involved in EnOS SHC.

## Container

A container is a special process model that provides hardware, operating system, storage, network capacity, and other resources required for application deployment and running, and provides high-performance and scalable management services for application development.

## Cluster

A cluster is a collection of computing, storage, and network resources that can be used to run various container-based applications.

## Pipeline

The essence of a pipeline is a complete process covering from application development to delivery, which links the different phases and tasks (build, code scanning, Jenkins jobs, etc.) in the process and can be set to be executed automatically step by step.

## APaaS

Refers to the application platform as a service, or simply platform-as-a-service, which is a cloud computing service model. It provides users with the hardware, operating system, storage and network capacity needed to run existing applications  or develop new applications on the cloud. APaaS helps to simplify the technical complexity for building and deploying applications, and is easier to maintain and scale. With APaaS, the development teams across different geographic locations can work together on software development projects through the cloud.
