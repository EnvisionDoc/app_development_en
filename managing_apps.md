# Managing applications
EnOS™ provides developers with the ability to create applications, delete applications, purchase application, and manage applications within the organization.

## Registering an application

Click **Register App** and fill in the application information:

- Select a category for the application.
- Define whether the application is a web or mobile app.
- Upload the application icon.
- Register resources such as menus, views of the application so that you can assign different permissions to the application for different customers.

## Purchasing an application

Application developers can sell or purchase applications through EnOS™. This facilitates application sharing and reduces repetitive work on developing similar applications.

- Application developers can purchase the applications of their own.
- When client A wants to purchase an application developed by client B, client B submits a sale request to EnOS after negotiating the sales deal with client A, and the EnOS system administrator will allocate the relevant application of client B to client A. Client A can then see the application in the **Purchased Apps**  tab.

## Application asset authorization

When you purchase or develop an application, the related resources in the organization are authorized for the application by default.

<!--

When you purchase or develop an application, you can authorize your resources to the application. The steps are described as follows:

1. Click **IAM > App Authorization**.
2. Locate the application to authorize assets for and click the **Asset Authorization** icon "![](media/app_authorize_icon.png)".
3. Select the assets to authorize for the application and click **Authorize**.
