# Managing Roles

Application Portal supports the creation of different roles. After assigning the application permission and menu access permission to a role, the user of that role would gain access to the corresponding menus and operation permissions within the application.

- Menu group: A menu group is a collection of menus displayed in an application, which is formed by combining menus. Once a menu group is assigned to a role, the user of that role would have the rights to access any menus in the menu group.
- Permission: Permission is the privilege name that is named in an application and has specific operations. When a permission is assigned to a role, the user of that role would have the appropriate operational permissions within the application.

## Create a Role

1. Log in to the Application Portal admin console and select **Role** from the navigation bar.
