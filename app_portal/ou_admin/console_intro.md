# Basic Operations in Admin Console

The admin console is intended to help administrators and sub administrators of an enterprise or organization on centralized management and hierarchical management based on permissions for users, roles, organization structure, applications, and other aspects.

## Basic Operations

1. The OU administrator or sub administrator of an enterprise or organization logs in to the Application Portal. The login page URL format is `https://app-portal.{domain_name}/login`, where `domain_name` is the domain name for deploying the Application Portal service. Since different cloud services and instances have different service addresses, please contact the Envision project manager or technical support for corresponding service information.

2. After logging in the Application Portal, the OU administrator or sub administrator will enter the application page of the Application Portal homepage if there is one or more applications that are accessible.

3. Click **Admin Console** in the upper right corner of the page to enter the admin console, as shown below:

4. If there is no application that is accessible, the OU administrator or sub administrator will enter the admin console directly.

After entering the admin console, the OU administrator can perform application management, user management, permission management, and other operations.
