## Key Capabilities

The Application Development Service of EnOS Console provides the following benefits:

**Ready-to-use**

An application can access the EnOS™ APIs immediately after the application is registered on EnOS™.

**Secure and reliable**

EnOS™ isolates the data of different clients and ensures that different clients can only access their own asset data when using the same application.

**Data integration**

EnOS™ System integrates the ingested asset data, applications, and EnOS APIs, so that all asset data can be accessed and modified through APIs after authorized with applications.

**Cross-organization application authorization**

When you need to use an application developed by a third party organization, you can authorize the application to access the asset data of your organization.
