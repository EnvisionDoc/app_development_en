# Using Base Shape Tools

Base shape tools are the basic elements for creating the graph, including text, line, rectangle, polyline, pie, image, etc. This topic introduces how to insert base shape tools in the graph.

## Procedure

1. From the **Base Shape Tool** navigation bar, select the base shape to be used, move the cursor to the graph area, left-click the mouse, move the mouse to draw the shape, and left-click the mouse again (for text and image, left-click the mouse just once).

2. In the pop-up window or in the **Property Window** on the right of the page, set the properties of the base shape to complete inserting the base shape in the graph area. Take the text base shape as example, the pop-up window for editing properties is as follows:
