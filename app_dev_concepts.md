# Concepts

This article introduces the major concepts involved in application development.

## accessKey

To call the EnOS™ APIs, an application must have an *accessKey* (application key). The *accessKey* is the identifier of an application that is assigned by EnOS™ after the application is registered on EnOS™. An application can have one or more application keys.

## secretKey

The *secretKey* (application secret) is the secret to the application key. When an application attempts to access resources on EnOS™ through the EnOS™ APIs, the application must present both the application key and application secret to be authenticated and authorized.

## Application resources

Application resources indicate the menus, operations, data, and graphic interface controls and elements of an application.

<!--

EnOS™ allows application developers to manage the access permissions to the application resources. Developers can register application resources as controlled resources. When the application is shared with a client, the application developer can assign appropriate permissions to the controlled resources for the client using the EnOS Application Framework.EnOS Stream Processing Engine supports multiple data types with specific data processing templates. The data type of a measure point telemetry is defined when configuring the device model.
